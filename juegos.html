            Bonk is a multiplayer physics game, for up to eight players at once.
            Push your opponents off the edge of the level, the last man standing
            wins! Battle your friends or anyone from anywhere in the world in
            last man standing or team based matches. Bonk.io is a game of
            strategy as well as raw skill, position yourself carefully, and
            dodging an incoming collision can be as effective as smashing into
            your enemies! Use the arrow keys to move, and hold X to make
            yourself heavier. When you are heavy, you have much more momentum,
            so you will bash enemies much further, and you are much harder to
            push around. But you will also be much less maneuverable!
